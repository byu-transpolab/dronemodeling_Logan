  abstract = {Changes in electric power consumption patterns of a country over a period of time reflect on its socio‐economic development and energy utilization processes. In the present study, we characterized spatial and temporal changes in electric power consumption patterns over India during 1993 to 2002, using ‘night‐time lights’ data given by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program–Operational Line Scan System ({DMSP}‐{OLS}) over the Indian region. The {OLS} operates in two bands: visible (0.5–0.9 µm) and thermal (10.5–12.5 µm) and has a unique capability of picking up faint sources of visible–near infrared emissions (lights) at night on the Earth's surface including cities, towns and villages with a {DN} value ranging from 1 to 63. Night‐time light images for cloud‐free dates given by the {DMSP}‐{OLS} from 1993 to 2002 were segregated into respective years and were integrated to generate one ‘Stable light image’ per year. Changes in light scenarios over the Indian region in the decadal time frame were studied using stable lights datasets from 1993 to 2002. Information on changes in the light scenarios was integrated with demographic data to characterize developments in major cities and states of India. Results of the study suggested an increase in population by 170 million and power consumption from 44962 million {kWh} to 306355 million {kWh} over the country during 1993–2002, which was associated with an overall increase in number of night‐time lights of up to 26\% in all states, indicating development in electric power consumption patterns. Correlation analysis between increase in population to the increase in night‐time lights and electric power consumption showed a coefficient of determination, R 2, of 0.59 and 0.56 respectively. Increase in light intensities along the peripheries of major Indian cities was observed, which indicated increased stress on the cities and corresponding development in power consumption patterns during the decadal time frame. Certain states, however, showed a decrease in night‐time lights in some areas, which are primarily attributed to the decreased economic growth trend and poverty and accounted to the scatter observed in the correlation analysis. Results are discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {As the backbone and arteries of a comprehensive transportation network, highways play an important role in improving people’s living standards and promoting economic growth. However, globally, there is limited quantifiable data evaluating the highway traffic state, characteristics, and performance. From the 1960s to the present, remote sensing has been regarded as the most effective technology for long-term and large-scale monitoring of surface information. However, how to reflect the dynamic “flow” information of traffic with a static remote sensing image has always been a difficult problem that is hard to solve in the field. This study aims to construct a method of evaluating highway traffic prosperity using nighttime remote sensing. First, based on nighttime light data that indicate social and economic activities, a highway-oriented method was proposed to extract highway nighttime light data from 2015 annual nighttime light data of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor ({SNPP}-{VIIRS}). Subsequently, Pearson correlation analysis was used to fit the relationship between freeway traffic flow volume and freeway nighttime light at the provincial level. The results showed that Pearson Correlation Coefficient of freeway nighttime light and freeway traffic flow volume for coach and truck are 0.905 and 0.731, respectively, which are higher than between freeway traffic flow volume for coach and truck and total nighttime light (0.593 and 0.516, respectively). A new index—Highway Nighttime Traffic Prosperity Index ({HNTPI})—was proposed to evaluate highway traffic across China. The results showed that {HNTPI} has a strong correspondence with socio-economic parameters. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient of {HNTPI} and gross domestic product ({GDP}) per capita, consumption per capita, and population are 0.772, 0.895, and 0.968, respectively. There is a huge spatial heterogeneity in China nighttime traffic, the prosperity degree of highway traffic in developed coastal areas is obviously higher than that inland. The national general highway is the most prosperous highway at night and the national general highway nighttime prosperity of Shanghai reached 22.34\%. This research provides basic data for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of regional traffic operation at night and research on the correlation between regional highway construction and the economy.},

  abstract = {Several global and regional efforts have been undertaken to map human-made settlements and their characteristics, including building material, area, volume, and population. However, given the unprecedented amount of Earth observation data and processing power available, there is a timely need for developing novel approaches for mapping these characteristics at higher spatial and temporal resolution. Such information is key to effectively answering questions related to population growth, pollution, disaster management, risk assessments, spatial planning, and even generating business cases in peri-urban and rural areas. While such data is available from mapping agencies or commercial companies in some countries, there are many countries where this is not the case. The main objective of this study is to propose an Inception-{ResNet} inspired deep learning approach to estimate the characteristics and location of human-made structures, including estimates of population, based on Earth observation data from the Copernicus Programme. The study investigates the effects on prediction accuracy using data from different orbital directions and interferometric coherence from Sentinel 1 data and different band combinations of Sentinel 2 data as model input variables. The model is trained and evaluated on a nationwide Danish case study, where the national mapping agency provides high-quality open data on human-made structures, which serves as the ground truth data for the study. Our findings reveal that it is possible to design models that, on average, perform within 2.6\% total absolute percentage error for area predictions, 7.7\% for volume and 17\% for population at 10 by 10 m scale using only Copernicus data and deep learning models. The models achieved 98.68\% binary accuracy for extracting structural area when all test sites were merged. Combining Sentinel 1 and 2 input variables yielded the best results, while adding interferometric coherence did not significantly improve accuracy. Furthermore, including data from both orbital directions of the Sentinel 1 constellation significantly improved model performance.},

Given the growing inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of studies focused on understanding the human dimensions of global change ({HDGC}), the need for a synchronization of agendas is evident. We conduct a bibliometric assessment and review of the last two decades of peer-reviewed literature to ascertain what the trends and current directions of integrating remote sensing into {HEI} research have been and discuss emerging themes, challenges, and opportunities. Despite advances in applying remote sensing to understanding ever more complex {HEI} fields such as land use/land cover change and landscape degradation, agricultural dynamics, urban geography and ecology, natural hazards, water resources, epidemiology, or paleo {HEIs}, challenges remain in acquiring and leveraging accurately georeferenced social data and establishing transferable protocols for data integration. However, recent advances in micro-satellite, unmanned aerial systems ({UASs}), and sensor technology are opening new avenues of integration of remotely sensed data into {HEI} research at scales relevant for decision-making purposes that simultaneously catalyze developments in {HDGC} research. Emerging or underutilized methodologies and technologies such as thermal sensing, digital soil mapping, citizen science, {UASs}, cloud computing, mobile mapping, or the use of “humans as sensors” will continue to enhance the relevance of {HEI} research in achieving sustainable development goals and driving the science of {HDGC} further.},

  abstract = {Drones are increasingly becoming a ubiquitous feature of society. They are being used for a multiplicity of applications for military, leisure, economic, and academic purposes. Their application in academia, especially as social science research tools, has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade. This has been possible due, largely, to significant developments in computerization and miniaturization, which have culminated in safer, cheaper, lighter, and thus more accessible drones for social scientists. Despite their increasingly widespread use, there has not been an adequate reflection on their use in the spatial social sciences. There is need for a deeper reflection on their application in these fields of study. Should the drone even be considered a tool in the toolbox of the social scientist? In which fields is it most relevant? Should it be taught as a course in the social sciences much in the same way that spatially-oriented software packages have become mainstream in institutions of higher learning? What are the ethical implications of its application in spatial social science? This paper is a brief reflection on these questions. We contend that drones are a neutral tool which can be good and evil. They have actual and potentially wide applicability in academia but can be a tool through which breaches in ethics can be occasioned given their unique abilities to capture data from vantage perspectives. Researchers therefore need to be circumspect in how they deploy this powerful tool which is increasingly becoming mainstream in the social sciences.},

The objective of this work was to collect, curate, organize and test a set of open source tools for aerial data capture for research purposes. The Open Science Drone Toolkit was built through a collaborative and iterative process by more than 100 people in five countries, and comprises an open-hardware autonomous drone and off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and guides and protocols that enable the user to perform all the necessary tasks to obtain aerial data. Data obtained with this toolkit over a wheat field was compared to data from satellite imagery and a commercial hand-held sensor, finding a high correlation for both instruments. Our results demonstrate the possibility of capturing research-grade aerial data using affordable, accessible, and customizable open source software and hardware, and using open workflows.},

We extracted three urban categories (countryside, peri-urban, and core-urban) for each city using objectively derived thresholds from the brightness gradient ({BG}) approach. The peri-urban and coreurban combined categories were generally found to increase over time for all cities whereas countryside urban category decreased implying strong spatial and temporal trends in urbanization. These trends were also found to be sensitive to geographic characteristics of cities. The study showed that the {BG} approach can be successfully applied to extract and study growth dynamics of diﬀerent urban categories for Southeast Asian cities having range of demographic and socioeconomic conditions. The {BG} derived urban categories compared favourably with Landsat derived impervious areas, where the former was found to envelope the high percentage impervious region derived from the latter. The {BG}-derived urban areas are lastly compared against the population data to explore linkages with population growth.},

Linear regression models based on lifestyle segmentation variables were used to predict air passenger trips for Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. The study focused on predicting trips that originated from or terminated at residences in Atlanta's 13-county metropolitan area. The lifestyle regression models were compared with regression models based on income, because the latter were similar to the regression models currently used by the Atlanta Regional Commission to predict home-based airport passenger trips. The results provide directional evidence for using lifestyle clusters over income groups in predicting airport passenger trips. The evidence suggests that alternative data sources with adequate information for lifestyle segmentation can improve airport passenger models. The discussion points out the need for air passenger surveys to collect information about the number of annual air trips a surveyed individual takes.},

In developing this unique proxy, we apply machine-learning techniques to a historical time series of daytime satellite imagery dating back to 1984. Compared to satellite data on night light intensity, another common economic proxy, our proxy more precisely predicts economic activity at smaller regional levels and over longer time horizons. We demonstrate our measure’s usefulness for the example of Germany, where East German data on economic activity are unavailable for detailed regional levels and historical time series. Our procedure is generalizable to any region in the world, and it has great potential for analyzing historical economic developments, evaluating local policy reforms, and controlling for economic activity at highly disaggregated regional levels in econometric applications.},

Detecting building footprint has a substantial position in decision-making problems such as city planning and development, urban mapping and management, population estimation, etc. In this paper, we aim to automatically detect and count building footprints by leveraging deep learning techniques and the potential availability of remote sensing datasets at high spatial resolutions. We build object detection deep learning models by integrating the partitioning segmentation and convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) architecture using the {WorldView}-3 very high-resolution optical satellite imagery data. Our detection model is implemented on data from the Paris, France, and Khartoum, Sudan regions. These regions were chosen because it has very different characteristics and large data variation, making it challenging to extract building features from satellite imagery. This challenge is even greater because one area is taken perpendicularly and the other area is taken at an angle of several degrees which causes more noise, one of which is the shadow of the building. The detection models can detect and count the building footprints and have promising performance on large variable data with an Average Precision ({AP}) of 64.19\%. Paris was detected better by 74.66\% compared to Khartoum by 56.19\%. The partitioning segmentation technique is used to tune the anchor boxes of {CNN} input images. Our result offers a potential practical implementation for rapid yet accurate estimation of urban monitoring and city planning, particularly in metropolitan regions.},

These images are processed to provide various output products, including point cloud, digital surface model ({DSM}), digital terrain model ({DTM}), and ortho-mosaiced image. This study uses point cloud data obtained from {UAV} data processing to extract buildings automatically. It utilizes the geometric features obtainable from the point cloud data in a defined neighbourhood to classify the point cloud data. Normalized {DSM} ({nDSM}) is also used as an input to identify above-ground features more accurately. Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm has been used to classify the point cloud data into different classes available in the dataset. After classification, buildings are separated from the point cloud data, and K-Means clustering is performed to segregate different building clusters. These clusters are rasterized, and morphological operations are applied to refine the building edges. Then the boundaries of the building clusters are identified to provide the vector data. Accuracy assessment of the automatically extracted shapes is done by comparing their area, perimeter, and centroid location to the reference building polygons generated through the total station survey. The methodology is tested over the dataset acquired through {UAV}. An open-source {GUI} (graphical user interface) based tool has been developed in Python to extract the vectorized building shapes from photogrammetric point cloud data and compute areas automatically.

We further analyzed the spatial, slope, and hydrological distribution characteristics of {HAILS} and explored the drivers of {HAILS} changes. The results show that the areas with higher {HAILS} were mainly located in the central part of Hefei, as well as along the Yangtze and the Huaihe rivers. The largest changes from 2015 to 2020 happened in the gentle slopes with the {HAILS} of 20–30\%, and the percentage of {HAILS} {\textgreater} 20\% decreased over the slope of 15°. In the riparian zone, the {HAILS} showed a clear decreasing trend after 2 km, while the {HAILS} in 2020 were higher than in 2015 in each flow-path distance belt, except for the Huaihe river. The {HAILS} index was strongly correlated with population density, rural population density, urban population density, average land {GDP} of primary industry, and nighttime light data. The rapid growth of the urban population and economy, as well as ecological protection policies, were identified as drivers of the above changes. Therefore, the {HAILS} in 2015 and 2020 of Anhui Province provide effective data support to address regional ecological conservation issues.},

  abstract = {The fine 3D model is the essential spatial information for the construction of a smart city. {UAV} aerial images with large-scale scene perception ability are common data sources for 3D modelling of cities at present. However, in some complex urban areas, a single aerial image is difficult to capture the 3D scene information because of the existence of some problems such as inaccurate edges, holes, and blurred building facade textures due to changes in perspective and area occlusion. Therefore, how to solve perspective changes and area occlusion of the aerial image quickly and efficiently has become an important problem. The ground image can be used as an important supplement to solve the problem of missing bottom and area occlusion in oblique photography modelling. Thus, this article proposes a progressive matching method via multi-scale context feature coding network to achieve robust matching of aerial-ground remote sensing images, which provides better technical support for urban modelling. The main idea consists of three parts: (1) a multi-scale context feature coding network is designed to extract feature on aerial-ground images efficiently; (2) a block-based matching strategy is proposed to pay more attention to local features of the aerial-ground images; (3) a progressive matching method is applied in block matching stage to obtain more accurate features. We used eight sets of typical data, such as aerial images captured by the drone {DJI}-{MAVIC}2 and ground images captured by handheld devices as experimental objects, and compared them with algorithms such as {SIFT}, D2-net, {DFM} and {SuperGlue}. Experimental results show that our proposed aerial-ground image matching method has a good performance that the average {NCM} has improved 2.1–8.2 times, and the average rate of correct matching has an average increase of 26\% points with the average root of mean square error is only 1.48 pixels.},

  abstract = {Landscape patterns and building functions are successfully used to provide the social sensing information of urban areas. However, previous studies treated ground objects equally, ignoring their size differences. Considering the different contributions of various types of ground objects in land-use classification, this paper measured nine area-weighted mean landscape-level metrics to describe landscape patterns based on the land-cover map, derived from remote sensing images. Additionally, the same idea was applied for identifying building functions. Impervious surfaces, which occupy the majority of urban areas, have a decisive impact on land-use classes. In terms of this, this paper proposed the impervious surface area-weighted building-based indexes from the building outline data. To better represent the physical structure of urban areas, the entire study was based on the analysis units delineated by the {OpenStreetMap} road network. Finally, a random forest model combining the landscape-level metrics and building-based indexes was adopted in Wuchang District of Wuhan city, China. The results showed that the proposed method was effective at describing landscape patterns and identifying building functions for accurate urban land-use classification, increasing the precision by 10.67\%. In general, the contribution of landscape-level metrics to the urban land-use classification is slightly greater than that of building-based indexes. Moreover, different land-use types of analysis units express different landscape patterns. It is of great significance for improving urban form and guiding future urban design. The paper demonstrates that area-weighted landscape metrics and building-based indexes offer a better understanding of urban land use, which plays a vital role in urban planning, construction, and management.},
